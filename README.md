# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

Object destructuring to add object properties as dependencies to useEffect():  

const { someProperty } = someObject;  
useEffect(() => {  
  // code that only uses someProperty ...  
}, [someProperty]);  
This is a very common pattern and approach...   

The key thing is NOT that we use destructuring but that we pass specific properties instead of the entire object as a dependency.  

We could also write this code and it would work in the same way:  

useEffect(() => {  
  // code that only uses someProperty ...  
}, [someObject.someProperty]);  
This works just fine as well!  

But we should avoid this code:  

useEffect(() => {  
  // code that only uses someProperty ...  
}, [someObject]);  
Why?  

Because now the effect function would re-run whenever ANY property of someObject changes - not just the one property (someProperty in the above example) our effect might depend on.  
  
  # useState() vs useReducer()

  # Component Trees & Component Dependencies (Introducing React Context)  
  ![Component_Trees_ _Component_Dependencies-Introducing_React_Context](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5030950/127431385-6ab764d8-efab-4dd7-b584-93e652388795.jpg)

  We are forwarding data through the MainHeader to the Navigation component (10-013)
  on props we receive in the MainHeader, even though we don't really need the data there
  So, we could easily build "prop chains" which are used to forward data through components 
  to other components.
  It would be nicer if we could use props in a component to only receive the data 
  this component really needs from its parent, 
  and not forward our data through the parent which the parent doesn't even manage 
  nor need itself. 
  And for that we got a component-wide, "behind the scenes", State Storage, built into React.
  We have a concept called React Context and this then allows us to, for example, trigger an action
  in that component-wide State Storage, and then directly pass that to the component 
  that is interested without building such a long prop chain.
